## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite with four main tables:

- **categories**: Item categories
- **items**: Grocery items with category and unit
- **prices**: Price entries with item, store, price, date, and notes

## Data Export

The SQLite database file (`grocery_prices.db`) can be:
- Backed up by copying the file
- Queried using any SQLite browser/tool
- Exported to CSV or other formats using SQLite commands

## Customization

### Adding Default Stores

Edit the `init_db()` function in `app.py` to add your preferred stores:

```python
stores = [
    ('Your Store Name', 'Yellowknife, NT'),
    # Add more stores...
]
```

### Adding Default Categories

Edit the categories list in the `init_db()` function:

```python
categories = ['Produce', 'Dairy', 'Your Category', ...]
```

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Design**: Modern, responsive UI with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Record prices regularly**: Try to record prices during your shopping trips
2. **Use notes**: Add notes for sales, bulk purchases, or quality differences
3. **Track common items**: Focus on items you buy frequently
4. **Compare trends**: Use the trends view to identify price patterns and optimal buying times
5. **Check store comparison**: Before shopping, check which store has the best prices for your needed items

## Troubleshooting

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Database errors:**
- Delete `grocery_prices.db` and restart the app to recreate the database

**Port already in use:**
- Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`
